## What is a Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP)?

- It is easily repeatable
- It is easily extendable
- It is automated
- It minimises mistakes
- It is fast
- It builds trust

## Let's think about a traditional analysis

## What are the issues?

- Lots of manual steps
- Hard to repeat
- Mistakes are easy to make and hard to track
- The steps aren't recorded
- How do we keep track of which file versions people have?

## What about a RAP?

## All the functionality in one place

<img src="images/ReproducibleAnalyticalPipeline_expanded.png" width="90%" height="auto" align="center">

## What are the benefits?

- It is easy for others to use
- Others can change and adapt
- All steps are recorded
  - Including whilst it is built
- It is automated
- It is fast
- It is open and promotes trust

## Is it Data Science?

<img src="images/BuildingBlock.png" width="100%" height="auto" align="center">

No, it is a building block that's essential for data science!

## What do we need?

- Open-source tools
- Version control with `git`
- To consider reproducibility
- Time to learn
  
## Why open-source instead of proprietary?

- Huge online community for support
- Flexible to all data sources
- Free for anyone to use - it is easier to share
- Flexible to all output types

## What is version control?

Tracking the three **W**s: **W**ho made **W**hich change and **W**hy? <br><br>

## For example, take a look at this [presentation](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/gov-uk-rap-materials)

## Why use version control?

<img src="images/logos/git_logo.png" width="40%" height="auto" align="right">

<br>

- One place to store your code
- You and collaborators free to write and develop locally
- Complete documented history of all changes made
- Easy to share
- Your future self will thank you! :-)

## Which version control should I use?

| Tool                                                              | Cost   | Where is master? | Advantage              | Disadvantage
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------- | -----------------------|
| [Github](https://github.com/)                                     | Free   | Online           | Huge user base         | \$\$\$ for private repositories 
| [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)                               | Free   | Local or Online  | Continuous integration | Smaller user base
| [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)                               | \$\$\$ | Cloud            | Cloud security         | Harder to share
| [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/repos/) | \$\$\$ | Cloud            | Cloud security         | Harder to share

## What do we mean by reproducible?

<br>

We want to look back and be able to repeat our work easily and quickly.

What are the benefits?

- Helps build trust
- Not reliant on single individual
- Can be adapted and re-used

## Making a Reproducible Analytical Pipeline is difficult

Here are a few things to consider:

- IT infrastructure available
- Data privacy - where and how am I storing my data?
- Expertise - what training do I need?
- Legacy systems - what are the barriers to transitioning?

## But it is worth it!
